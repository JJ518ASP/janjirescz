    <h2>RaspberryPiFoundation: Introduction to Machine Learning and AI</h2>
    <h3>Week 1</h3>
    <h4>What emotions or feelings have you experienced during your studies this week?</h4>
    <p>This week, I felt excited and curious as I began exploring the foundational concepts of machine learning and AI. At times, I also experienced a bit of frustration when new technical terms and ideas felt complex, but overall I remained motivated to understand the material. I really felt a bit of relief, when I found out, that the main part of this course takes place in Discussion format. I also felt really amazed by the Teachable machine and that I got to make a program in my first week!</p>
    <h4>What are the key concepts or skills you have learned so far in this first week?</h4>
    <p>I learned about the basic definitions of AI and machine learning, including how machines can be trained to recognize patterns and make decisions from data. I also gained insight into types of machine learning models, the process of training, and the importance of datasets. I got to brainstorm some ideas for new games and create a functioning program with no code utility!</p>
    <h4>What progress have you made toward your learning goals or project milestones?</h4>
    <p>I successfully completed introductory exercises and familiarized myself with the Teachable Machine tool, which allowed me to design and train a simple model for classifying different hand gestures. This hands-on practice strengthened my understanding of supervised learning concepts. One of the most practical and fun exercises from my AI learning journey so far.</p>
    <h4>What challenges or problems have you faced during your learning, and how did you attempt to solve them?</h4>
    <p>The main challenge I faced was time pressure, as balancing my schedule with the course workload required careful planning. Additionally, I needed to acquire a webcam to participate fully in the exercises that involved training models with live video input. :D</p>
  	<h3>Week 2</h3>
    <h4>What emotions or feelings have you experienced during your studies this week?</h4>
    <p>This week, I felt intellectually stimulated by the more theoretical approach, especially as we dove into the scope of problems that AI can solve and the need for critical thinking when identifying suitable applications. At times, the concepts around regression and the discussion of bias and variance made me pause and reflect, as they seemed more abstract compared to the hands-on activities from before. I felt a sense of responsibility when learning about data collection ethics and potential biases, realizing how these issues shape real-world AI impact.</p>
    <h4>What are the key concepts or skills you have learned so far in this first week?</h4>
    <p>I gained insight into framing real-world problems for AI solutions, learning how to distinguish which problems are appropriate for machine learning. The lesson on regression showed me how AI can be used to predict continuous outcomes, such as estimating age or prices, by identifying patterns in data. The sections on data science and data preparation built my understanding of how crucial it is to meticulously collect and organize data. Importantly, I learned about the ethical aspects of data collection and the significant effects of bias and variance on AI model performance—the difference between models that are too simplistic and ones that overfit the data. The discussion on bias in recruitment highlighted how unbalanced data can lead to unfair outcomes.</p>
    <h4>What progress have you made toward your learning goals or project milestones?</h4>
    <p>This week, I completed theoretical and practical activities that deepened my comprehension of how to properly prepare datasets, as well as how to spot and address ethical and statistical pitfalls in real AI projects. I worked through examples of bias and variance and reflected on bias in recruitment, strengthening my ability to critically analyze how algorithms work in different social contexts. My approach to future projects is now more systematic, as I’m more aware of the hidden layers of complexity in what might seem like purely technical challenges.</p>
    <h4>What challenges or problems have you faced during your learning, and how did you attempt to solve them?</h4>
    <p>One significant challenge was visualizing how bias and variance affect model outcomes in practice—it took some rereading and looking up extra examples to make these concepts clear. When confused by the specifics of regression, I turned to supplementary resources and revisited the video explanations, which helped bridge the gap between abstract math and practical applications. Understanding data ethics was sobering and occasionally overwhelming, but engaging with case studies and class discussions made the concepts more tangible and relevant.</p>
