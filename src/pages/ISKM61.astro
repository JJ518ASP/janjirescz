    <h2>RaspberryPiFoundation: Introduction to Machine Learning and AI</h2>
    <h3>Week 1</h3>
    <h4>What emotions or feelings have you experienced during your studies this week?</h4>
    <p>This week, I felt excited and curious as I began exploring the foundational concepts of machine learning and AI. At times, I also experienced a bit of frustration when new technical terms and ideas felt complex, but overall I remained motivated to understand the material. I really felt a bit of relief, when I found out, that the main part of this course takes place in Discussion format. I also felt really amazed by the Teachable machine and that I got to make a program in my first week!</p>
    <h4>What are the key concepts or skills you have learned so far in this first week?</h4>
    <p>I learned about the basic definitions of AI and machine learning, including how machines can be trained to recognize patterns and make decisions from data. I also gained insight into types of machine learning models, the process of training, and the importance of datasets. I got to brainstorm some ideas for new games and create a functioning program with no code utility!</p>
    <h4>What progress have you made toward your learning goals or project milestones?</h4>
    <p>I successfully completed introductory exercises and familiarized myself with the Teachable Machine tool, which allowed me to design and train a simple model for classifying different hand gestures. This hands-on practice strengthened my understanding of supervised learning concepts. One of the most practical and fun exercises from my AI learning journey so far.</p>
    <h4>What challenges or problems have you faced during your learning, and how did you attempt to solve them?</h4>
    <p>The main challenge I faced was time pressure, as balancing my schedule with the course workload required careful planning. Additionally, I needed to acquire a webcam to participate fully in the exercises that involved training models with live video input. :D</p>
